/**
 * End-to-end IT cases for the graph-level fusion of a convertible Calc into the native Auron Kafka
 * source. The {@code AuronOperatorFusionProcessor} (installed by the shadowed planner factory)
 * counts each source's consumers over the whole exec-node graph and, for a sole-consumer native
 * source with no event-time watermark, stages the Calc's {@code Project[Filter?]} sub-plan onto the
 * source; the shadowed {@code StreamExecCalc} then emits no standalone operator and the source runs
 * the fused {@code Project[Filter?[KafkaScan]]} pipeline. Because the consumer count is computed
 * graph-level, fusion fires under the <em>default</em> optimizer config — no reuse-disable is needed.
 *
 * <p>Each assertion distinguishes fused from not-fused rather than only checking the row set (a row
 * set alone is identical either way). The discriminator is the job graph in the {@code
 * JSON_EXECUTION_PLAN}: a fused Calc collapses into the source node, so the graph contains <em>no</em>
 * {@code Calc} operator; an unfused Calc keeps a separate {@code Calc} operator above the source.
